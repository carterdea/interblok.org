      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p>In May of 2014, family members of Graham and Alex came back from a relief trip to Manila, Philippines.  Alex saw a great need in the way we educate and care for orphans and children internationally. During this same time Graham had been exploring the world of architecture, upcycled building materials, and renewable resources. Enter the Shipping Container.</p>

      <h2>The Plan</h2>
      <p>The shipping container is stronger, safer, and faster to the field than traditional building materials. Taking modern prefabrication methods to shipping containers brings access to steel infrastructure to every port in the World. Our aim is to work with established orphanages in Latin America and the Caribbean to increase their capacity to provide for the children there.</p>
      <p>As we work with local communities we desire to bring design and supplies that are influenced by their needs. We will source as much labor and materials locally to stimulate their economy and create jobs in foreign markets.</p>
      <p>International orphanage needs range from playgrounds to full rebuilds.</p>

      <h2>The Progress</h2>
      <p>Beginning the project full time in March 2015, the past few months have been spent building relationships with orphanages, the shipping container industry, local state government, creative agencies, and other nonprofits. After obtaining 501C3 status, interBLOK has begun fundraising for their first full-scale project.</p>

      <p>$30,000 is our fundraising goal for our microCAMPUS project in Baja Mexico. We will deliver and build a shipping container classroom and playground with these funds. We look next to Belize for our first international port project, and then beyond.</p>
